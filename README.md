# Robust Control Workshop
This half-a-day (4 hour) workshop consists of three sections:
1. Classical Control Design Basics
2. Robust Control Analysis
3. Robust Control Design

Each of the sections can be complemented by an additional in-depth exercise found in the appendix:

1. Exercise 1: Tuning of Gain Scheduled Controller for a Three-Loop Autopilot
2. Exercise 2: MIMO Stability Margins for a Spinning Satellite
3. Exercise 3: Robust Controller Design for a Spinning Satellite
